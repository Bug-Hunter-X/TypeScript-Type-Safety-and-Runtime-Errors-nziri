# TypeScript Type Safety and Runtime Errors

This example demonstrates how TypeScript's type system can't fully protect against all runtime errors. While TypeScript enhances code reliability significantly, it does not guarantee the absence of runtime issues entirely.  The example focuses on the interaction of types and runtime behavior. The provided solution illustrates a potential approach to improving the robustness of the code.
